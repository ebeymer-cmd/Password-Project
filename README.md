# Password-Project
A repo for my Password Generator 
This repo is a holder for the password project I decided to try and do. I managed to write and create a generator that will follow all password rules for websites.
Most websites follow the rules: A certain amount of characters, an amount of special characters, an amount of numbers, and variation of lowercase and capital letters.
This file takes those rules, and gives the user a chance to enter the prompts it gives, asking for the amount given for each promopt. It correctly gives errors, and also asks if they even need to include it.
Overall, this project took me a full day of focus to complete.
I hope whoever looks at it enjoys!
